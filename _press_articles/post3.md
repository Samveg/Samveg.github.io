excerpt: "<p>Before you set foot in a single new car, MyGreenCar lets you virtually test drive thousands of options to narrow it down to the options that fit your lifestyle, tastes and values.</p><p>The models used in MyGreenCar, validated both in the lab and on the road, can predict true fuel economy for drivers within 10 percent — a significant improvement over the current EPA estimates that can regularly be off by 30 percent or more, according to Saxena.</p>"
