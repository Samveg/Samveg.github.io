excerpt: "<p>Thankfully, there is a new app on the market: MyGreenCar. Developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, MyGreenCar covers the entire car-buying experience.  MyGreenCar is currently supported by GreenLightLabs Inc. and is available in both the Google and Apple online app stores. So far this is the only tool that uses a car buyerâ€™s actual driving data to calculate a customized cost of ownership.</p>"
