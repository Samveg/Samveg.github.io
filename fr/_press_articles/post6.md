title: "Essential Charging Apps for EV Owners"
excerpt: "<p>A researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory created this app that lets drivers virtually test green vehicles. Users download the app, choose a few EVs they’re interested in and then drive their own car as usual. The app records data on your driving style—such as how you brake and accelerate, fast or slow—and conditions on your regular routes such as traffic and hills. The app then helps you evaluate which EV would best fit your lifestyle based on the data collected.</p>"
